                <h2>AUTONOMOUS BOREWELL RESCUE SYSTEM </h2>
                <p>
                    An Autonomous Borewell Rescue System using IoT is a smart, technology-driven solution designed to save children or individuals who accidentally fall into borewells. The system integrates IoT sensors, cameras, and robotic mechanisms to continuously monitor borewells and respond automatically during emergencies. Sensors detect human presence, depth, temperature, and oxygen levels inside the borewell, while a live camera provides real-time visuals to rescue teams through an IoT-enabled dashboard. The autonomous mechanism deploys a robotic arm or harness to safely secure the victim, and communication modules enable two-way audio to comfort the person trapped inside. By enabling real-time data transmission, remote monitoring, and faster decision-making, this IoT-based system significantly reduces rescue time and increases survival chances compared to traditional manual rescue methods.

                <h2>AI POWERED SKIN ANALYSIS AND PRODUCT RECOMMENDER</h2>
                <p>
                    An AI-Powered Skin Analysis and Product Recommender is an intelligent system that uses artificial intelligence and deep learning techniques to analyze skin conditions and suggest suitable skincare products. The system processes facial images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify skin issues such as acne, pigmentation, dryness, or redness. Based on the detected skin condition and skin tone, the model maps the results to a curated product database and recommends personalized skincare products. This automated approach helps users make informed skincare decisions, reduces trial-and-error product selection, and provides accessible, data-driven skincare guidance through a user-friendly web interface.

                <h2>RESUME SCREENING SYSTEM USING NLP</h2>
                <p>
                    A Resume Screening System using Natural Language Processing (NLP)** automatically analyzes resumes to identify the most suitable candidates for a job role. It extracts key information such as skills, education, experience, and achievements, then compares it with the job description to evaluate relevance. NLP techniques like text classification, keyword matching, entity extraction, and semantic similarity help the system understand meaning beyond simple keywords. This reduces manual effort, speeds up hiring, minimizes human bias, and ensures that only highly relevant resumes move forward in the recruitment process.
